COVID-19 UPDATE
As of February 29, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel to South Korea is currently not advised. Please see the U.S. Embassy & Consulate Alerts and Messages website for more information.

At this time, Sein and I believe it is too early to determine the effect on our July wedding plans in Korea. Unless the answer becomes obvious earlier, we intend to wait until June to make this judgment.

If you have already purchased a flight ticket, I advise you to check with your airline to understand your options in case travel is still not advised through July. You may also look into "Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR)" insurance policies, which would help in the event that you are uncomfortable traveling, regardless of restrictions. If you have decided to wait to buy, or if you have decided not to come, Sein and I completely understand. Please update your RSVP accordingly or give us a call.

We are hopeful that this will all clear up so that we may gather for fun and healthy celebration all together this summer in both Seoul and Boston. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
